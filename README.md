## todo-app-frontend

This repo is the front end for [todo-app-backend](https://github.com/daviadenisco/todo-app-backend/blob/master/README.md).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Setup

First, you'll want to install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Now you should be able to run:
```
npm start
```

This command runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Test Runner

To run the test runner in interactive watch mode, run:
```
npm test
```

### Production Builds

To build the app for production, run:
```
npm build
```
This will bundle React in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance (e.g. minification). Your app should now be ready to be deployed!
